# Robox.txt_counter

WhatWeb plugin
<pre>
This plugin was adapted from Brendan Coles's plugin (<bcoles@gmail.com>): https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb/edit/master/plugins/robots.txt.rb
This plugin returns the length of robots.txt.rb's output.
The idea is to get a general size of the site.

### Disclaimer

I dont code in ruby and this plugin was hacked together at 2:00 AM

# Usage:
```
./whatweb -p plugins/robots.txt_counter.rb https://www.google.com

https://www.google.com [200 OK] robots_counter[ Length 326]
```
